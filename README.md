Included is a rough timeline below. Fill this in from week to week to show your progress throughout semester

## week 1 - Selecting a Project

My topic is: terrain generation with wave function collapse

## week 2 - Reading

## week 4 - Reading

What I did this since last week: Since last week was my first real week and I spent most of it just finding starting points for research,  this week I spent the time to better read through these sources and understand them fully as well as which ones I can still learn from and which I have gotten all I can.

Better defining my project goals:  
  - create a simple wfc implementation with 5 tiles: one blank and four "T" shaped, one in each possible rotation.  
  - expanding this to a more complex tile set to generate a 2D "terrain" or "landscape" similar to Oskar stalbergs "wave", with the main difference functionally being   that this algorithm should handle asymetrical tiles.  
  - going back to the first tileset/algorithm but adding random rotation such that the number of tiles is reduced to two, one blank and one "T" where the "T" tile can   be randomly rotated to functionally fill the role of 4 tiles.  
  - create an equivelent 3D implementation of the second algorithm, one that can handle asymetrical, predefined tiles without rotation.  
  - create a 3D implementation that reduces the number of premade tiles by handling random rotation.  
  - Write accompanying technical document.

[Processing article on WFC with additional sources on implementation](https://discourse.processing.org/t/wave-collapse-function-algorithm-in-processing/12983)  

I think the model that I am interested in for the sake of this project is known as the "tile model"  

tile model implies the necessity of date structures to hold the information of tiles which can be made with abstract code.  

[Procjam tutorial containing info on both models](https://www.procjam.com/tutorials/wfc/)  
the overlapping model can be linkened to the mathematical principal: "markov chain"
